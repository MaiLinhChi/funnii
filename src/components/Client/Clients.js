        "Coolest game ever played because of the way I feel their special effects once I pop them I love this version because once I pop the bubble I can feel the bubbles and hear them pop as well and it is great anyhow these are by far the most colorful balls Iâ€™ve ever seen in this kind of a game and I also love the extra thin round rims around each ball too.  I often am more relaxed because I donâ€™t have to require to think ahead and especially when I am being timed on itðŸ––",
